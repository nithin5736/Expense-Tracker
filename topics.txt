React basics & components-->
    npx create-react-app folder
    first component
    Adding CSS
    Outputtng dynamic data
    props concept
    splitting single component into multiple components
    wrapper components("children props")

React state & handling events-->
    listening to events
    useState()
    every component has its own seperate state(each ExpenseItem in Expenses has its own seperate state)
    Adding form inputs
    listening to user inputs & obtain user entered value
    using multiple states for different inputs
    using a single state instead of multiple inputs("use concept of object")
    updating state depends on previous state
    Handling form submission
    Two-way binding(listening to user input to gather value & reset the input values)
    children-to-parent commuication or passing data(by passing functions)
    lifting the state up
    ExpenseFilter-->1. gather input(listening to input) ,2. pass data to parent,3. define a state for the year
    Controlled vs Uncontrolled components(ExpensesFilter is controlled component because the current and changed values are handled in parent component)
    state vs stateless components(ExpenseItem is stateless component)
    
Rendering lists & conditional content-->
    Rendering lists of data(using map())
    using stateful lists
    key props(unique key to identify each individual)
    conditional content(ternery operator, &&, storing JSX code in a variable)
    conditional return statements
    Adding dynamic styles
